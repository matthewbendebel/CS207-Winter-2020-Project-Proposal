# CS207-Winter-2020-Project-Proposal
# Mini Weather Station using the Arduino
by: Matthew Dylan Bendebel and Su Wai Tin

This repository will display how to make an 8-button game controller on the Arduino for Assignment #4 in CS207: Building Interactive Gadgets (Winter 2020).

The game controller's input, built based on the Arduino, will controlled by pushbutton switches. Once the buttons are pressed, it will send commands to the computer via serial.


2) Suggest a modification to the project.
3) Describe your motivation behind the project you've identified / the modifications you've decided upon.
5) At least four (4) realistic milestones and corresponding dates and a fifth "reach" milestone. More is good. Less is bad.
6) Identify the role of each team member (if you're in a team). 
7) Provide a summary
